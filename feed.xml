        <title>Don&#39;t Be A Pirate</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;postimage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/DOsIB.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wild frontier of the Internet allows new forms of piracy. Hacking, pornography, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)&quot;&gt;black markets&lt;/a&gt;, and digital theft abound, and the Internet provides anonymity. Although you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do these, you really not. Contrary to what Captain Barbossa implied, everyone should stick to the &quot;Code.&quot; The code of right and wrong, when ignored, leads only to more misery. I am not talking about any &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics&quot;&gt;specific&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_code&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;, but rather, the divine code inside all humans. Follow your internal moral compass. Seek the good, noble, inspiring, and honorable. If you feel a need to hide your actions, they are probably wrong. Don&#39;t be a pirate: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=true&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=ef1eb8179f4bb010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&amp;vgnextoid=21bc9fbee98db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&quot;&gt;be good&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Computer Addiction and Programmers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The most dangerous part of computer addiction for a programmer is it creates an outstanding employee or brings fame to the software creators. The difference between diligent programmers and computer addicts can be minor. Both may work harder than average, think and dream in code, and enjoy programming regardless of pay. If not restricted, however, programming too much leads to hygiene neglect, social withdrawal, sleep deprivation, low physical activity, and obsessive thinking. Like any substance or behavioral addiction, this can destroy family relationships, impair health, and damage spirituality. Spending large amounts of time working does not necessarily mean a programmer is addicted: rather, an programming addict is one who cannot seem to stop. Computer addicts who program can easily indulge, justifying long hours of programming on &quot;earning an income&quot; or &quot;advancing my career.&quot; This danger is only intensified by employers happy to have for these diligent, self-motivated coders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;You can read more about addiction and programming in this uncited yet interesting article:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://virtuecenter.com/blog/the_effects_of_computer_programming_on_the_brain.html&quot;&gt;The Effects of Computer Programming on the Brain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Rebuttal For Mark Bauerline</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;postimage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5535/10974149904_ed037ef5dc_o.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have never read a book more infuriating than &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Dumbest-Generation-Stupefies-Jeopardizes/dp/1585427128&quot;&gt;The Dumbest Generation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Its author, Mark Bauerline, predicts a grim future based on statistics about my generation. His facts may be accurate, but his interpretation is wrong. No, the sky is not falling. Here are a few reasons why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change does not jeopardize the future. The technology of communication has changed many times. Neither the printing press, typewriter, nor telegram crashed civilization. Rather, they sped the Enlightenment, Reformation, and Scientific Revolution. Likewise, the Internet is an opportunity, not a curse. It lowers the cost of widespread publication. Expensive books limited publication of ideas to highly literate authors. Blogging and social media expand publishing power to all.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Civic activity is not the only variable in producing quality government. Cultural pressure, wealthy lobbyists, foreign affairs, and the health of the economy influence government, too. Today&#39;s youth may not vote, campaign, or lobby as much as the youth of the 1950s, but this is not necessarily a decline: it is change. Decades ago, the public square was the place to share and spread ideas. Today, the public square is the Internet. The political tools of decades past must adapt to advance of digital communication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the intellectual future of the United States is brighter than ever. My so-called &quot;dumbest&quot; generation is exposed to an ever wider and diverse stream of ideas, but this does not dull or stupefy. Exposure sharpens our power to filter, discern, interpret, and analyze. My generation cannot be sheltered from learning about lifestyles, opinions, and cultures different from our parents&#39;. We learn younger and better how to judge credibility, ignore noise, and make decisions. The intellectual future rests in our hands, and we come as hungry to know and think as any generation past. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Engineer-ette</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cirtl.net/node/5424&quot;&gt;Many women feel unwelcomed in computer science&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a shame they feel so because computer software companies need more women programmers. Between all programmers I have met working for BYU, Microsoft, and Ancestry.com, I have only known one woman software engineer. She worked as a testing engineer, and wrote code as well as any. Her most important contribution was her elevating and tempering effect on the men. When she was absent, conversation revolved around Xbox victories, bar-hopping feats, and food. When present, the men adjusted to a nobler vocabulary. Although she bragged about beer festivals too, she favored discussion about social dynamics, management styles, and civics. I am glad she did not let the gender ratio dissuade her from working there. I learned as much from her as I did from anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Lunch-break Soccer Game</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some problems cannot be solved by computers. For example, organizing a lunch-break soccer game among co-workers is not solvable via computers. It is best solved by face-to-face invitations. In the last 6 months at my job, I have seen 3 attempts to organize this group. One person setup a small website to send reminders. Another started a spammy, email message list. A third tried text messaging. The problems of these digital format are easy to identify. 1-Recipients ignore the messages. 2-Messages are often duplicated, distorted, or incorrect. 3-Responses give little indication of who will actually show up. In the end, these attempts fall flat and we resort to the old-fashion method: verbal communication.  &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Every Computer Science Major Should Work During School</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;postimage&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T3AtaL8V1wE/Unu0LBhKfsI/AAAAAAAAED8/yyRpw3WyFbE/s800/companies.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every university student studying computer science or engineering should seek part-time employment while still in school. Even those pursuing positions in academia should try it.&amp;nbsp;I have held 4 programming positions while in school. Work teaches what school cannot. School has taught me some theory and skill, but work&amp;nbsp;has taught me the importance of communication, marketing, and user testing. School has taught me how to write C++, Java, and others. Work has taught me that valuable software solves a problem. School has taught me how to get a grade. Work has taught me how to work on a team. School has given me a toolset of knowledge and information. Without work, however, I would not know how to use those tools to create something &lt;i&gt;real people&lt;/i&gt; will use.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reading Nonfiction Is Inefficient</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;postimage&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_Lb-OJFWqvo/UnuyBSF9aLI/AAAAAAAAEDw/GghvRbwIjgU/s800/Open+Book.jpg&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet is a satisfactory substitute for reading nonfiction cover-to-cover. The reading habits of the younger generation reflect this attitude. Studies&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/11/19/young_people_reading_a_lot_less/?page=full&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16739654&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=lpq3ryL1c6sC&amp;dq=the+dumbest+generation&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; show those 25 and younger read books significantly less than previous generations. For anyone in this group, such as me, this seems obvious. Read books for days, even weeks, and you might find the information you seek. Google it for minutes, maybe hours, and you will find the same thing. Unless you are a Ph.D. student, the overabundant information in books is extraneous, especially in technical and historical books. So why read nonfiction cover-to-cover? The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatschools.org/reading/7071-non-fiction-why-its-important.gs&quot;&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt; others give are not compelling.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>You&#39;re On Your Own — &quot;The Cuckoo&#39;s Egg&quot; Review</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;postimage&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ThA7eLXfxAM/UmALVJhikPI/AAAAAAAAEAk/Gk65-ZLkanE/s1600/castle.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main point of &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Cuckoo&#39;s Egg&lt;/i&gt; is not what I expected. The book describes Clifford Stoll&#39;s first year as a hacker-hunting system administrator for Berkeley. I expected a dry, technical description of computer networks. Although the story briefly addresses the technical details of network hacking, it contains more human drama and politics. The book&#39;s main point is philosophical: networks cannot rely on government for security. The digital world is a wild country where the only set rule is, &quot;Every man (computer) for himself.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long does it take city police to respond to a reported robbery? Typically less than a day. Often less than hours. Stoll repeatedly points this out as he narrates his frustrated attempts to get government assistance.  75% of the book repeats an incident that occurred weekly throughout 1986: Stoll found the hackers attacking U.S. Government systems. He called the CIA, NSA, FBI, Air Force, or Army. The organization thanked him (sort of), but ultimately shrugged their shoulders. It took a year of Stoll&#39;s nagging to eventually to shut down the hackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disturbing account of ignored pleas for protection indicate an important caveat to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;social contract&lt;/a&gt;. Although we depend upon government authority to provide physical security and protection of property rights, government is nearly powerless to defend digital rights. We cannot surrounded the United States&#39; digital land with armies to fight foreigners. Instead, every man (computer) must build his own fortress for protection. Venture into the Internet without a firewall or virus protection if you dare, but be prepared to face digital threats alone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bitcoin and Cloud Crime</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Bitcoin_logo.svg&quot; height=&quot;64&quot; width=&quot;306&quot; style=&quot;box-shadow:none;-webkit-box-shadow:none; border:none&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin (BTC), a digital-only currency, became popular after its sudden burst of valuation in early 2013. This currency is completely digital, and no government or institution backs it or regulates exchange. This makes BTC perfect for cyber-crime (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.extremetech.com/tag/silk-road&quot;&gt;the Silk Road,&lt;/a&gt;) and raises an increasingly relevant question: who governs the Internet? Since the establishment of computer networks, governments have attempted to regulate their use (for example, the U.S. Government made &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN&quot;&gt;ICANN&lt;/a&gt;.) When the operators of Internet activites are located in U.S. Government, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.extremetech.com/computing/168139-fbi-unable-to-seize-600000-bitcoins-from-silk-road-operator&quot;&gt;the FBI does not hesitate to intervene.&lt;/a&gt; But what happens when Internet crime spreads across many borders? This is a question that this generation will decide. Although some governments have established international agreements to cooperate, there is no answer yet. These treaties have not been tested on matters of digital, government-less currency yet, but that will change soon. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Types of Tweets about #ldsconf</title>
        <description>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SPZjHnSL1f8/UlGHULRysXI/AAAAAAAADzs/DfVfpkwnAwc/s1600/IMG_0372.PNG&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;172&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; style=&quot;border:none;box-shadow:none;-webkit-box-shadow:none;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SPZjHnSL1f8/UlGHULRysXI/AAAAAAAADzs/DfVfpkwnAwc/s640/IMG_0372.PNG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;p&gt;This weekend (Oct. 5 &amp;amp; 6) is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lds.org/general-conference?lang=eng&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LDS General Conference&lt;/a&gt;. You can follow this event live on Twitter by watching the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ldsconf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#ldsconf&lt;/a&gt;. If you are new to this, here are the 4 types of tweets people will post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;1. Quotes and summaries.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most common type. These bite-sized chunks of sermon may be tasty, but the whole meal is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lds.org/general-conference?lang=eng&quot;&gt;LDS.org&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.byutv.org&quot;&gt;BYUtv.org&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-partner=&quot;tweetdeck&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Honor your covenants,,,and the Holy Ghost will become the driving force of your life.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ldsconf&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#ldsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PresidentPacker&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#PresidentPacker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Caitlyn Lewis (@clewlis) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/clewlis/statuses/386588154632732672&quot;&gt;October 5, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Political comments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LDS Church teaches some politically provocative beliefs. For instance, women are not allowed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mormon.org/faq/purpose-of-priesthood&quot;&gt;hold the Priesthood&lt;/a&gt;. This year&#39;s hot topic among Utah Mormons is women&#39;s rights, largely due to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ordainwomen.org/project/my-name-is-kate/&quot;&gt;Kate Kelly&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; Ordain Women movement.  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;  data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sister Carole Stephens, courageously and meekly addresses the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23OrdainWomen&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#OrdainWomen&lt;/a&gt; movement with simple, pure doctrine. Beautifully done. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ldsconf&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#ldsconf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nathan H. (@cabogirao) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cabogirao/statuses/386535529472217088&quot;&gt;October 5, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;3. Opposing viewpoints&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone tweeting is an LDS fan. Don&#39;t be surprised by the occasion jab at a particular speaker or doctrine; opponents love to ride the #ldsconf wave to spread their viewpoints.  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;  data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ldsconf&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#ldsconf&lt;/a&gt; Uchtdorf contradicts scripture, here&amp;#39;s how: Paul insisted that local clergy be compensated (1 Corinthians... &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/tzGs7DIBKD&quot;&gt;http://t.co/tzGs7DIBKD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; MRM (@mrmdotorg) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mrmdotorg/statuses/386546114238750720&quot;&gt;October 5, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h3&gt;4. Humor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speakers of General Conference are typically very reverent and solemn, i.e. GC is not exactly a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pacific_rim_2013/&quot;&gt;blockbuster action film&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s no surprise many will try to spice it up. Something as simple as a new black General Authority can &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hintonbr/status/386542191222349824&quot;&gt;create some buzz&lt;/a&gt; and a multitude of memes. &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hehe saw this on Instagram and had to repost &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ldsconf&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#ldsconf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/8NWNZLhljT&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/8NWNZLhljT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mele (@meleemma) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/meleemma/statuses/386541147411058688&quot;&gt;October 5, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
