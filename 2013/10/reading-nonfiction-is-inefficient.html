The reading habits of the younger generation reflect this attitude. Studies<sup><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/11/19/young_people_reading_a_lot_less/?page=full">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16739654">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lpq3ryL1c6sC&dq=the+dumbest+generation">3</a></sup> show those 25 and younger read books significantly less than previous generations. For anyone in this group, such as me, this seems obvious. Read books for days, even weeks, and you might find the information you seek. Google it for minutes, maybe hours, and you will find the same thing. Unless you are a Ph.D. student, the overabundant information in books is extraneous, especially in technical and historical books. So why read nonfiction cover-to-cover? The <a href="http://www.greatschools.org/reading/7071-non-fiction-why-its-important.gs">reasons</a> others give are not compelling.</p>

    Many ideas are far more complex than can be expressed in as many words as will fit in a few Wikipedia articles or essays. If you want to gain even an elementary understanding of, for example, the issues that burden the Middle East, you&#39;ll have to read a few books. You probably know less about the issues you read about on the internet than you realize.

    Thanks for your comment. Apparently I have been unclear. I am not suggesting I am equally educated by reading a few Wikipedia articles. Rather, I am suggesting that the nature of a book—its linear presentation of information—does not make it ideal for learning some subjects.  I have studied the issues about the Middle East in depth (and even spent 4 months living in Israel studying the issues.) While studying, I found that I often read multiple books at the same time, flipping between different chapters, reading those chapters out of order. This is what I claim is inefficient—the way a book organizes information makes learning inefficient if you are only reading cover-to-cover.

    I think nonfiction books still have a place in an online society, but the balance is definitely shifting. Buying or borrowing a book is now a commitment towards a topic - if you buy Beehtoven&#39;s biography, you&#39;re probably not doing it on a whim, you&#39;re doing it because you very definitely know you want to know more about Beehtoven. You&#39;re to the point that you want information that someone worked hard enough to get that they wanted paid for it. On a related note: I actually learned a lot of the basics of programming from a book.
