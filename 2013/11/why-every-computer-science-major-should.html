Even those pursuing positions in academia should try it.&nbsp;I have held 4 programming positions while in school. Work teaches what school cannot. School has taught me some theory and skill, but work&nbsp;has taught me the importance of communication, marketing, and user testing. School has taught me how to write C++, Java, and others. Work has taught me that valuable software solves a problem. School has taught me how to get a grade. Work has taught me how to work on a team. School has given me a toolset of knowledge and information. Without work, however, I would not know how to use those tools to create something <i>real people</i> will use.</p>
