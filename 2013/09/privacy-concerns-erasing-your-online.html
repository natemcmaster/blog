Can the government force companies to respect privacy? <a href="http://t.co/zzM3KTNOu7">Apparently, yes.</a> California will now require internet companies to hide all information about minors, upon their request. But this leads to a more interesting question: <i>should</i> the government force companies to respect privacy? I used to believe the answer was no. In my hands-off political style, I often said "Why should they? Users have agreed to the Terms of Use and volunteered their information." That was until I decided to download by profile.* When I did, I was shocked by how much information I had <i>volunteered. </i>Google knows everything I have emailed since 2004. And&nbsp;Facebook knows everything about my birth, parents, residence, occupation, education, hobbies, religion, relationships, and appearance. Would I like to take some of that back? Yes. Can I? No. Should the government change that? I believe so.<br /><Br><small>*Try downloading yours from <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout/" target="_blank">Google</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dyi?x=AdnJ_-AoZVtbPrlz">Facebook</a></small><br /><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">New California law will let minors digitally erase their online past <a href="http://t.co/zzM3KTNOu7">http://t.co/zzM3KTNOu7</a><br />â€” The Verge (@verge) <a href="https://twitter.com/verge/statuses/382303775852986370">September 24, 2013</a></blockquote><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
