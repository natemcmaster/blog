        <h1>What's mentoring?</h1>
        <p>
            If you are a freshman/sophomore and considering a software-related career, I'd love to share my experiences with you. I've worked for several tech companies and interviewed with half-a-dozen more. Learn from my mistakes and successes&mdash;they may help you navigate through school and into a career. Mooch off me for a Jamba or lunch on-campus while you ask any questions you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some of the ways I can help.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Network with Microsoft interns and future full-time employees</li>
            <li>Learn about career opportunities in software</li>
            <li>Prepare your résumé tips and practice for programming job interviews</li>
            <li>Get help choosing a major and/or classes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

                <a href="/resume/">Learn more about my background.</a>
