<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Bitcoin_logo.svg" height="64" width="306" style="box-shadow:none;-webkit-box-shadow:none; border:none"/></div><p>Bitcoin (BTC), a digital-only currency, became popular after its sudden burst of valuation in early 2013. This currency is completely digital, and no government or institution backs it or regulates exchange. This makes BTC perfect for cyber-crime (such as <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/tag/silk-road">the Silk Road,</a>) and raises an increasingly relevant question: who governs the Internet? Since the establishment of computer networks, governments have attempted to regulate their use (for example, the U.S. Government made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICANN">ICANN</a>.) When the operators of Internet activites are located in U.S. Government, <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/168139-fbi-unable-to-seize-600000-bitcoins-from-silk-road-operator">the FBI does not hesitate to intervene.</a> But what happens when Internet crime spreads across many borders? This is a question that this generation will decide. Although some governments have established international agreements to cooperate, there is no answer yet. These treaties have not been tested on matters of digital, government-less currency yet, but that will change soon. </p>

    Considering that there has never been a united world organization, I imagine that there will never be a proper way to deal with bitcoin.

    Good point. I think there&#39;s probably gonna have to be some sort of worldwide catastrophe before countries start working together to beef up internet security sadly.
