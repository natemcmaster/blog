The Internet is a satisfactory substitute for reading nonfiction cover-to-cover. The reading habits of the younger generation reflect this attitude. Studies[<sup>1</sup>](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/11/19/young_people_reading_a_lot_less/?page=full) [<sup>2</sup>](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16739654) [<sup>3</sup>](http://books.google.com/books?id=lpq3ryL1c6sC&dq=the+dumbest+generation) show those 25 and younger read books significantly less than previous generations. For anyone in this group, such as me, this seems obvious. Read books for days, even weeks, and you might find the information you seek. Google it for minutes, maybe hours, and you will find the same thing. Unless you are a Ph.D. student, the overabundant information in books is extraneous, especially in technical and historical books. So why read nonfiction cover-to-cover? The [reasons](http://www.greatschools.org/reading/7071-non-fiction-why-its-important.gs) others give are not compelling.
