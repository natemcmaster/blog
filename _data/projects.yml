    <p>
      ASP.NET Core is an open-source web framework for .NET. While on this project I have been
      a regular contributor to various parts of the stack, including Kestrel HTTP Server, dotnet-watch,
      and .NET Core in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      I switched to this team full-time in August 2016. For the first 5 months I primarily helped convert
      the entire build system and tools (like dotnet-watch) from project.json to MSBuild. I then
      moved on to runtime components of the web stack.

  description: >
    <p>
      A data-access framework for .NET. Entity Framework Core is a lightweight and extensible version
      of the popular Entity Framework data access technology. This makes it easy for developers to create
      and access databases as well as manage changing database schemas.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first interned on this project in 2014 (when it was called EF 7) and prototyped using EF 7 for
      Azure Table Storage. I joined the project as a full-time software engineer in Spring 2015.

- title: SQLite for ADO.NET (Microsoft.Data.SQLite)

  description: >
    <p>
      This library allows interaction with SQLite databases using ADO.NET patterns and interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      This library was primarily created by Brice Lambson of the Entity Framework team. When EF Core
      was created, System.Data.SQLite was not suitable as the lower-layer component. Brice started this
      project to create a cross-platform, .NET Core-compatible, lightweight implementation of
      System.Data.Common contracts for use with Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SQLite.

    <p>
      NuGet packaging for the native components of SQLite. These are available at
      https://www.nuget.org/packages/SQLite
    </p>
    <p>
      This package provides the native libraries required to execute SQLite on any platform where
      .NET Core is supported. It is officially owned by the SQLite Team, but I created the package for
      them as they were unfamiliar with how to create a native package that works on Linux, Windows, macOS, etc.
