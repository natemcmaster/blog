  <p style="line-height:1.8em;"><i>Not everything can be solved with technology.</i>&nbsp;For a programmer bent on conquering the world, this idea is a bitter but important one to swallow. To some, it tastes like defeat. I gulped this idea down a few months ago, though I had long resisted. Last year, a semester of "Tech Entrepreneurship" had me convinced there was no problem unsolvable for the most creative and daring keyboard wizards. Accordingly, I&nbsp;set sail into heart of the tech world. A quiet summer in Redmond taught me why&nbsp;technology is inherently constrained. New in this city where men pray with smartphones and laptops fall from the sky, I had a problem no circuit could ever solve: I needed friendship. Sorry Nokia, your hardware cannot shake my hand, smile, or hug. Sorry Bill, your software cannot know humor, loyalty, or passion. Sorry Zuck, Facebook doesn't work either. Please don't misunderstand: technology is highly useful, and a productive field for business and study. Yet despite their advantages, bits and bytes do not feed the soul.&nbsp;When I need a friend who understands mercy, laughter, patience, and wisdom, I can only get this face-to-face with real people.</p>
