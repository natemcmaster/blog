  <p>Some problems cannot be solved by computers. For example, organizing a lunch-break soccer game among co-workers is not solvable via computers. It is best solved by face-to-face invitations. In the last 6 months at my job, I have seen 3 attempts to organize this group. One person setup a small website to send reminders. Another started a spammy, email message list. A third tried text messaging. The problems of these digital format are easy to identify. 1-Recipients ignore the messages. 2-Messages are often duplicated, distorted, or incorrect. 3-Responses give little indication of who will actually show up. In the end, these attempts fall flat and we resort to the old-fashion method: verbal communication.</p>
