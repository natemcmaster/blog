  <p><a href="http://www.cirtl.net/node/5424">Many women feel unwelcomed in computer science</a>. Itâ€™s a shame they feel so because computer software companies need more women programmers. Between all programmers I have met working for BYU, Microsoft, and Ancestry.com, I have only known one woman software engineer. She worked as a testing engineer, and wrote code as well as any. Her most important contribution was her elevating and tempering effect on the men. When she was absent, conversation revolved around Xbox victories, bar-hopping feats, and food. When present, the men adjusted to a nobler vocabulary. Although she bragged about beer festivals too, she favored discussion about social dynamics, management styles, and civics. I am glad she did not let the gender ratio dissuade her from working there. I learned as much from her as I did from anyone else.</p>
