Plex TV announced the release of their Xbox 360 and One client today.
For Xbox One, this is the first app that provides a simple way to stream
media via Xbox from a personal media server.

>(The Xbox apps will) be available for free for Plex Pass members on Tuesday Oct 7th for the Xbox One, and shortly after that for the Xbox 360. (Don’t have a console? We thought of everything: we’ll be giving an Xbox One away on our social media channels, so stay tuned.) If you don’t have a Plex Pass, you’ll be able to purchase the apps with a one-time fee after the Plex Pass preview period. Also, we focused on video for this initial release; rest easy knowing we’re working hard on adding photo and music support, but we didn’t want to wait to get it into your hands!

Unfortunately, this app will not be free. I am still looking forward to the expected release of a media player for Xbox One that comes with DLNA support.
