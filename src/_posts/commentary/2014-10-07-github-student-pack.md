I just received access to the GitHub Student Developer Pack. Obviously, I am very pleased to receive special access to discounted and free services. 

>There's no substitute for hands-on experience, but for most students, real world tools can be cost prohibitive. That's why we created the GitHub Student Developer Pack with some of our partners and friends: to give students free access to the best developer tools in one place so they can learn by doing.

[GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

Here is a list of some of the free services included:

- Atom
- Bitnami
- Crowdflower
- DigitalOcean
- DNSimple
- GitHub
- HackHands
- Namecheap
- Orchestrate
- Screenhero
- SendGrid
- Stripe
- Travis CI
