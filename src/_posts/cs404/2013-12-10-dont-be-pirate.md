The wild frontier of the Internet allows new forms of piracy. Hacking, pornography, [black markets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)), and digital theft abound, and the Internet provides anonymity. Although you *can* do these, you really not. Contrary to what Captain Barbossa implied, everyone should stick to the "Code." The code of right and wrong, when ignored, leads only to more misery. I am not talking about any [specific](http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics) [code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_code), but rather, the divine code inside all humans. Follow your internal moral compass. Seek the good, noble, inspiring, and honorable. If you feel a need to hide your actions, they are probably wrong. Don't be a pirate: be good.
