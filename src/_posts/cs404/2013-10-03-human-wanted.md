Do you have the ability to solve basic problems? Are you able to think logically and independently? If so, we have a job for you.

We are endeavoring to enter the genealogy of mankind into a computerized system. We have built the servers, networks, databases, and user interfaces to operate the world's largest and most powerful family history record. Our software developers have slaved to perfect performance and create clever code that will make your searches speedy and save your findings for centuries.

Despite this, our system will not work with **your** help. We may have a mountain of metadata, but we need a human to help us organize and make sense of this. Family history must be carefully handcrafted to be correct, and that's why we need you, a human.

Please apply at [FamilySearch.org](https://familysearch.org/register). No experience required. You can begin working immediately. Consider yourself hired.
