The most dangerous part of computer addiction for a programmer is it creates an outstanding employee or brings fame to the software creators. The difference between diligent programmers and computer addicts can be minor. Both may work harder than average, think and dream in code, and enjoy programming regardless of pay. If not restricted, however, programming too much leads to hygiene neglect, social withdrawal, sleep deprivation, low physical activity, and obsessive thinking. Like any substance or behavioral addiction, this can destroy family relationships, impair health, and damage spirituality. Spending large amounts of time working does not necessarily mean a programmer is addicted: rather, an programming addict is one who cannot seem to stop. Computer addicts who program can easily indulge, justifying long hours of programming on "earning an income" or "advancing my career." This danger is only intensified by employers happy to have for these diligent, self-motivated coders.
