<div class="postimage"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DOsIB.png"></div><p>The wild frontier of the Internet allows new forms of piracy. Hacking, pornography, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)">black markets</a>, and digital theft abound, and the Internet provides anonymity. Although you <em>can</em> do these, you really not. Contrary to what Captain Barbossa implied, everyone should stick to the "Code." The code of right and wrong, when ignored, leads only to more misery. I am not talking about any <a href="http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics">specific</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_code">code</a>, but rather, the divine code inside all humans. Follow your internal moral compass. Seek the good, noble, inspiring, and honorable. If you feel a need to hide your actions, they are probably wrong. Don't be a pirate: <a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=true&locale=0&sourceId=ef1eb8179f4bb010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____&vgnextoid=21bc9fbee98db010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD">be good</a>.  </p>
